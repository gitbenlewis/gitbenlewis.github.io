I am a biological data scientist, with a strong wet lab prior.

With over 10 years of experience in both academia and industry, I specialize in integrating multiomic bioinformatics approaches with cell and molecular biology to drive insight and accelerate discovery. My strong wet lab background and communication skills facilitate effective collaboration between dry lab and wet lab scientists, enhancing data-driven discovery.
